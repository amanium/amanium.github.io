I investigate firms' outcomes from lobbying, specifically lobbying on taxes. The main threat to identification is that firms that lobby tend to be larger and more profitable than other firms; this makes it difficult to determine exactly what outcomes are attributable to lobbying vs what is due to other differences. In order to separate these effects, I exploit the quasi random variation in lobbying induced by Senators' and Represenatives' assignment to powerful tax writing committees.  I find that firms are more likely to lobby if a Senator or Representative from their state is assigned to one of these committees.  Lobbying by small firms results in significantly higher employment.
